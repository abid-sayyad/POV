##Abstract
POV (Persistence of Vision) display is a type of electronic display technology that uses persistence of vision to display an image or text. It works by rapidly flashing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in a specific pattern to create an optical illusion of a static image. POV displays are often used in wearable devices and promotional products, such as LED wristbands and promotional toys.
